In this project I have applied a feed forward Neural Network to FARS dataset. This is following the implemenatation of the "Abdelwahab, H. T. and Abdel-Aty, M. A. (2001) ‘Development of Artificial Neural Network Models to Predict Driver Injury Severity in Traffic Accidents at Signalized Intersections’. 
The Neural Network is created from scratch using only Numpy and pandas. The Detailed description of the steps can be seen in the project report.
